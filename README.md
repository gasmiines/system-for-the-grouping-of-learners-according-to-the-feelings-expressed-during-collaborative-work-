# system-for-the-grouping-of-learners-according-to-the-feelings-expressed-during-collaborative-work-
The cohesion between the elements of a group has a great influence on the success of any collaborative work between the elements of that group. Hence the importance of the feelings shared in the group. It will therefore be a question of bringing together elements ready to collaborate together and having a minimum of sympathy between them. Feelings are extracted from communication between different members of a group during collaborative work. This project involves creating a regrouping assessment tool that allows: • the teacher to offer collaborative work to groups of students, • the students to communicate together in a group, • to determine which feelings are shared between the students, • group the students together based on the feelings expressed
